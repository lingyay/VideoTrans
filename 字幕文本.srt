1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
What's up, boss? I'm Ronnie Shen.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,880
Then I'm Michael Costa. This is Sports War, the show where we are legally not allowed to agree with each other.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,160
For example, if I say UFC needs to be more violent...

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,640
Oh, well, then I say fighters need to sell a difference as peacefully with a licensed therapist.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,440
Yeah, well, I'd like to introduce you to my two therapists, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,039
Oh, yeah? Well, I should go to therapy.

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,560
See, that's how I'm obsessed with your mom.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,320
Yeah.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,079
Yeah, man, exactly. You need to explore those feelings with a licensed medical professional.

10
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,119
I'll send you some names.

11
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,960
Hey, let's talk golf, okay?

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,120
Short game, amateur, handicap, ball washer.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,960
These aren't just Ronnie's nicknames.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,560
They're golf terms.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,519
And this week was a historic one on the links.

16
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:53,799
Tonight, Rory McAvoy is now one of only six golfers to win all four major golf championships, winning the Masters for the first time.

17
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,960
The kid who grew up in Northern Ireland...

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:04,439
...overcome with emotion, winning his first green jacket, 11 years, after winning his last major championship.

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,599
Wow, congrats to Roy McAvoy.

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,799
It took him 11 years to get a new green blazer.

21
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,280
And as someone currently serving a 20-year band from the men's warehouse, I can totally relate.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,120
This is totally different, you idiot.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,159
Rory was trying to accomplish one of the hottest things in all of sports.

24
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,760
You just took a dump in a fitting room.

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:30,119
Well, they guaranteed I was going to like the way I looked and breaking a verbal contract has consequences.

26
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,679
The point is, I'm happy for Roy McAvoy.

27
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,119
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not.

28
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:35,719
Okay? I don't want to seem happy.

29
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,159
Everyone knows that Irish people are the best when they're depressed.

30
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,159
Haven't you ever read James Joyce?

31
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,640
Hell, no, I'm a Frank McCourt man.

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,959
Well, he's Irish American dumbass.

33
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,399
Check your stats, bro.

34
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:58,680
McCourt was raised in the slums of Limerick and he spoke to the soul of Irish suffering like no man since William Butler Yates, dumbass, which brings to our eyes Irish eyes better than night.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,120
What will make Roy McAvoy cry in public next?

36
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,240
As always, brought to you by gambling.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Gambling.

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,599
The only thing you're really addicted to is having a good time.

39
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,840
You're moving on.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,759
The NBA Playoff starts Saturday.

41
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:18,360
But if you're a little girl with a big imagination like Costa, you also have a reason to be excited.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,879
Move over Ken.

43
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,439
LeBron James is a first male athlete to be part of the new Ken Basseter line.

44
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,039
And Barbie dolls, look at him.

45
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,800
The message on the back of the box says, a true MVP.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,879
Our LeBron James Ken Basseter's doll represents resilience, hope, and pride for the city of Akron.

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,919
This is the dumbest toy ever.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,159
I hope it comes of a brony James doll that you'll force to play with even though it sucks.

49
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,960
Well, brawn again, boy, toy.

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,719
I happen to love LeBron.

51
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,479
He has every, he has what every little girl wants in a doll.

52
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,639
Pride for the city of Akron.

53
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,799
Now, they can play until their hearts content with a middle-aged man dressed like a 14-year-old no notes.

54
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:11,719
They should expand this to other NBA legends, like Dennis Rodman, The Worm, The First Doll in Barbie history with the piercable scrotum.

55
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:17,239
Or my favorite, my favorite from the childhood, Will Chamberlain.

56
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,839
There are hundreds of different Barbies and he can have sex with all of them.

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,800
Which brings us to our extremely random endorsement deal Better the Week, presented by Joanne Fabrics.

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,560
Which athlete will sign the next extremely random endorsement deal brought to you by Gambley.

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,000
Gambley, they're doing amazing things with wheelchair now.

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,960
Look, let's go to the diamond.

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Baseball is a sport where you have to know your signs, right?

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,480
Curveball, pitching change.

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,599
I'll take four beers, no tip.

64
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,519
But this week, Bryce Harper took that to the next level.

65
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,359
Philadelphia Philly slugged her Bryce Harper is about to take another swing at Fatherhood.

66
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,279
And he got creative with the babies' baby's gender revealed during last ninths game.

67
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:06,359
Harper Ashford stopped trade turner to hand him either a bluer-a-pink bat before he went up to head as a gender reveal.

68
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,719
He found out right before he stepped up to the plate that he'll be having a baby boy.

69
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,959
This is awesome.

70
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,639
Baseball needs more medical tests revealed during games.

71
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,600
I want to see a runner slide into home in the Empire of Yells.

72
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,319
You are safe from Tasex disease.

73
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,200
Costner, you're out of your f***ing mind, all right?

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,040
This is ruining the game.

75
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,520
You can't be doing gender reveals at the plate.

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,560
Gender reveals are supposed to be for a close group of loved ones that you're hoping to injure with explosives.

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,040
Ronnie, I got your gender reveal bat right here.

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,200
Surprise, it's brown since you're a piece of shit.

79
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Well, costner.

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,360
Yeah.

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,120
For those of us who've had sex, this is a disaster, all right?

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,200
Baseball is the thing you think about when you're not trying to get someone pregnant.

83
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,560
Get your family planning out of my sports, okay?

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,240
Can we please see a baseball story that has nothing to do with sex?

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,840
The Baltimore Orioles double-a affiliate that chest-of-peak base-ox decided to unveil an alternative team identity to help them gain traction with new audiences.

86
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,399
That included the new alternative name, the Oyster Catchers, along with a brand new logo.

87
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,800
This logo, which at least to many seems to depict a baseball glove catching an Oyster, others interpreted a bit differently.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,399
The team took the criticisms to heart, deleting their unannouncedment within minutes, but later they unveiled a new new logo showing a bird holding a bat.

89
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,240
God dammit.

90
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,599
I'm never going to be able to slip and all you stuff of baseball glove ever again.

91
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,399
And that's the only way I like them.

92
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,519
What are you talking about, Ronnie?

93
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,199
The Oyster logo is great.

94
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,239
If anything, the new logo is the one that's perverted.

95
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:53,079
That bird is clearly flying away with some guy severed penis.

96
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,839
And you know what? That poor guy.

97
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,560
But those lucky baby birds, what a lunch.

98
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,839
This whole thing just confirms my belief that baseball team should get rid of logos entirely, okay?

99
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:18,680
If they're not sexualizing oysters that pissing off Native Americans, every team should just name themselves after their city, like a Philadelphia Phillies, the Boston-Bostonese, the Cleveland-Clevelandese, the Detroit-Titties.

100
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,759
Nothing sexual, okay?

101
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,600
I disagree, Ron.

102
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,959
All team names should be sexual, but educational.

103
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,800
Sex ed in this country is a joke.

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:36,600
But if the Philadelphia Philopian tubes play the Cleveland steamers, well now we're learning, which brings us to our four-carat diamond better the week.

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,279
What baseball mascot will Ronnie have a dream about tonight?

106
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,839
Brought to you by gambling.

107
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,560
Gambling.

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,199
Tons of cultures sleep outside.

109
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,800
All right, that's it for sportswear.

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,160
Join us next time when we debate what act of war, Jean-Marant, will should mine for his next celebration.

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,839
It's gotta be hitting a nuclear button, man.

112
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,519
I'm gonna hit that button.

113
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,120
This is a draw.
